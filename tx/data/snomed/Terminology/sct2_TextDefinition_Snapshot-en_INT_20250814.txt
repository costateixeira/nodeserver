Onset occurs in the neonatal period. Clinical signs of cholestasis usually appear in the first months of life with recurrent or permanent jaundice associated with hepatomegaly and severe pruritus. Patients usually develop fibrosis and end-stage liver disease before adulthood. PFIC2 is due to mutations in the ABCB11 gene (2q24) encoding the bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein resulting in impaired biliary bile acid secretion which leads to decreased bile flow and bile salt accumulation in hepatocytes with ongoing severe hepatocellular damage.	900000000000017005
